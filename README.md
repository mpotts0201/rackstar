Welcome to rackstar, the world's best exercise routine sharing app.  The initial goal of this app is to create an environment that easily shares lifting routines for beginners and veterans.  Users will create a profile and can submit their routines to be shared with the world.  Each routine can be for a specific body area, which will be determined by the title of the post. Each routine can be edited later by the user and also deleted.  Each routine can also contain comments from other users for input.
